## Milestone 3 Documentation

1. Our first navigation in our project is a popup display that is in the form of an exclamation mark above the fallen chair. We wanted to make the fallen chair one of the main focuses, and to redirect the user to look at it we had this since it is just hovering and seemingly out of place. As a result, they would get interested to look at the chair below the exclamation point. 

2. Our selection and navigation options were limited since we are using a google cardboard, so we did a focus on the gaze of the camera inside the virtual room. When the user focuses the camera to be placed on the floating exclamation point, it should be transformed into a much more clear text that is a description of what made this part of the room important in the crime scene. This is the type of interaction we have chosen to integrate given out limited options of lack of controllers. 

3. Our other navigation technique is the glowing areas for our crime scene. Since the virtual environment is primarily dark, the glowing areas help the user determine what they should be looking at and find the objects of focus more easily in the scene. And glowing things tend to draw a person's eye, so we thought this was the best for of 'bread crumbs' that would draw the user into looking at those specific areas.
